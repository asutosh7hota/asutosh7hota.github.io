        		<h1>Something more about me!</h1>
				<!-- /.blurb -->
				<p align="justify">I am from one of the oldest cities of the state, Cuttack and live in the city's capital, Bhubaneswar. I am lucky to have a great team of uninterrupted support system, my 3 friends and we call ourselves the <a href="https://winterfellws.co">Random thoughts</a>. </p>
				<p align="justify">I am pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the <a href="http://cet.edu.in">College of Engineering and Technology</a>. I have been an integral part f the
				college's technical society <a href="http://zairza.in">Zairza</a> I love binge watching and love cooking in my free time. Other than that I sketch caricatures and love reading.I follow tech blogs as well as codecamps and conferences on youtube. I started my journey into the opensource last winters and I must admit it has been a great experience. Currently I am focusing to get better at understanding the concepts of deep learning and neural nets, audited two courses <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu">CS229</a>
				and <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu">CS231n</a>. I have been referring concepts from <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf">ISLR</a> as it is a great read! Apart from that
				<a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/">Andrej Karpathy</a> has been a inspiration for the quest in machine learning and his blog seems a must read for enthusiasts in this field! It's always fun watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A">Siraj Raval's</a>
				awesome videos! Exploring more of data science each new day!

				<p align="justify">I have been associated with a few great folks around my city.I am a lead volunteer at <a href="https://www.gdgbbsr.com">Google Developers Group</a> Bhubaneswar. We organise meetups and events that encourages folks to join the opensource community and spread the love of computer science. Also have joined the <a href="http://www.ewb-india.org">Engineers without borders</a>, Bhubaneswar subsection which aims to improve the quality of lives of people who need the bliss of technology to improve their standard of living, especially improving awareness and education. </p>
