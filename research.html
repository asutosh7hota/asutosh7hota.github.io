  <li><p style="text-align:justify; font-size:13pt ">Collaboration with ESCORTS Limited</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p style="text-align:justify; font-size:13pt ">Our team got the seed funding for the proposed model of an autonomous weeder in collaboration with the research team of ESCORTS Limited. The system would use convolutional neural networks for achieving an efficient image classification system that would classify plants from unwanted weed. This would prove quintessential for the agriculture sector as it could possibly replace manual and chemical weeding techniques.</p></li>

    <li><p style="text-align:justify; font-size:13pt ">The work is under progress. Tensorflow is being used for machine learning embedded with an Nvidea Jetson TK2.</p></li>

	<ul>
		<li><p style="text-align:justify; font-size:13pt ">Seed funded project Doot 1.0 under the guidance of Mrs. Swarnalata Pati, the then HOD, Dept. Of CSE, College of Engineering and Technology, Bhubaneswar. The project envisaged the idea of establishing a communication model for the hearing and speech impaired individuals. The limitations of the flex sensors and data glove assisted technology was established and an improved model was proposed using leap motion controller. </p></li>
		<li><p style="text-align:justify; font-size:13pt ">The single handed alphabet system under the Indian Sign language system was adopted as the scope of the project. Different supervised learning approaches were used and a differential set division classification was proposed to increase the efficiency and robustness of the system.</p></li>
